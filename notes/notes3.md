### COMING WEEKS
* Making it work with either absolute or relative paths
* Layering filters
* Other SVG elements?
* Continuing animations
* The content of the talk
* Testing
* Bugs

* More commands(?) (add filter, apply filter, etc.)
    // Additional option: (past feature parity)
    // Your options are
    // apply filter
    // create filter
    // "convert" -- synonym for apply filter --none Or something
    // Here are their help texts. :P
* Refine "vocabulary" of commands?

### Upcoming days
* Make sure it can be nicely packaged and exported and run on other systems.
* Use something like Kong or whatever??

Next step. The configuration.
1. Parse the arguments the program was started with.
NOTE: Eventually I want to make it possible to start up the program WITHOUT any configuration (in/out/whatever) provided, and then add it in later.


REALISTIC LIST OF STUFF TO DEAL WITH
* selected type. I don't like it at all. How can it be more elegant? Surely there's some way to add variadic whatnot.
* retries; interactivity re: user input
* applying the filters
    * layering the filters
* errors and error handling
* Get "inheritance" working in a better way
* testing
